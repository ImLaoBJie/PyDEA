=========================

This example doesn't do much, it just makes a simple plot

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 9-15

This is a section header
------------------------
This is the first section!
The `#%%` signifies to Sphinx-Gallery that this text should be rendered as
rST and if using one of the above IDE/plugin's, also signifies the start of a
'code block'.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 15-22

.. code-block:: default


    # This line won't be rendered as rST because there's a space after the last block.
    myvariable = 2
    print("my variable is {}".format(myvariable))
    # This is the end of the 'code block' (if using an above IDE). All code within
    # this block can be easily executed all at once.





.. rst-class:: sphx-glr-script-out

 .. code-block:: none

    my variable is 2




.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 23-28

This is another section header
------------------------------

In the built documentation, it will be rendered as rST after the code above!
This is also another code block.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 28-30
